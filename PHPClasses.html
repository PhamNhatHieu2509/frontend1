    <p>To use GitLab Pages, first you need to create a project in GitLab to upload your website's files to. These projects can be either public, internal, or private, at your own choice. GitLab will always deploy your website from a very specific folder called public in your repository. Note that when you create a new project in GitLab, a repository becomes available automatically.</p>
